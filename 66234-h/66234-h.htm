<p class="center">See the <a href="#frontispiece">Frontispiece</a>.</p>

<div class="blockquot_ans">
<p><i>Materials&mdash;16 skeins of Pink and the same of White single Berlin Wool; 3 skeins of White
Floss Silk. Walker’s Tricot Needle No. 5 Bell gauge.</i></p>

<p><i>The Tatting&mdash;A large Shuttle, and for the pearl loops a short mesh, which measures 1¾ inches in
circumference, and another 1¼ round, are required.</i></p>
</div>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Crown.</span></p>

<p>Commence with the White wool and the Tricot needle; make a chain of 15 stitches. The
whole of the stitches should be worked very loosely.</p>

<p>1st row&mdash;Miss the last 4 chain stitches, and work a plain crochet stitch into the next stitch
of the foundation chain; then (make 2 chain, miss a stitch of the foundation and work 1
plain crochet stitch, 5 times); turn back.</p>

<p>2nd row&mdash;Make 2 chain, miss 2, and work 1 plain stitch in the 2 chain of the last row; repeat
to the end, then to Increase work 2 chain and 1 plain again in the last loop; turn back.</p>

<p>Work 7 rows more, the same as the last, when it will be increased to 14 loops. It should
measure seven inches across without stretching.</p>

<p>Work 9 rows of the same stitch, but omitting the increased loops at the end of the rows.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">{4}</span></p>

<p>19th row&mdash;To decrease, miss the last stitch and work 1 plain in the last loop of chain; then
2 chain and 1 plain as before, to the end.</p>

<p>Work 8 rows more as the last. Then work a row of 1 chain and 1 plain in each loop.</p>

<p>Join on the Colored wool, and work a row of plain crochet all round, working two stitches to
the side of each of the white rows.</p>

<p>For the second round&mdash;Work 4 chain, miss 1 and 1 plain. Repeat and fasten off.</p>

<p>Use the Floss Silk and an Embroidery Needle. Work an ordinary Cross stitch over each of
the plain stitches of the Crown, putting the needle into the open spaces.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Tatting Flowers.</span></p>

<p>1st <span class="smcap">Circle</span>&mdash;Wind the colored and White Wool together, and fill the Shuttle with it, using
the doubled wool as one thread.</p>

<p>Commence a loop, work a double stitch; then using the largest mesh for the pearl loops, work
(1 pearl and 1 double alternately 16 times); draw close; leaving a small circle in the
centre about the size of the 2nd mesh, and knotting the ends firmly together, cut them off.</p>

<p>2nd <span class="smcap">Circle</span>&mdash;Use the colored wool doubled, and the second sized mesh. Commence a loop,
work 1 double, then (1 pearl and 1 double 12 times); draw close and fasten off.</p>

<p>3rd <span class="smcap">Circle</span>&mdash;Use the White Floss, and for the pearl loops the Tricot needle can be used.
Commence a loop; work 1 double, (1 pearl and 2 double 8 times); draw close. Fasten off.</p>

<p>Place the second circle over the first, and the silk one in the centre, sewing them together
with the silk, then attach them to the crown about an inch from the edge of it.</p>

<p>Make nine Flowers for the Crown and four for the Lappets.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Lappets.</span></p>

<p>Work with the White wool and Tricot needle. Make a chain of 11 stitches.</p>

<p>1st row&mdash;Raise 11 loops in the ordinary Tricot stitch, and work back, see <a href="#Page_28">page 28</a>.</p>

<p>2nd row&mdash;Raise a loop, Increase a loop, raise 2 loops; then to <i>decrease</i>, put the needle into the
three next stitches, and bring the wool through them all. Raise the 2 next loops as before.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">{5}</span>
Increase again, and raise the 2 last loops. There will be 11 loops on the needle. Work
back as before. Work 8 rows more as the last.</p>

<p>11th row&mdash;Raise the 1st stitch and increase a loop as before; then decrease the two next
stitches, taking them together as one stitch; take the next three loops together; then
take the two next loops together as one stitch, then Increase a loop as before, and raise the
two last loops. There will now be 9 loops. Work back.</p>

<p>12th row&mdash;Raise a loop and increase as before; raise the next loop, then take 3 together, raise
a loop, increase, raise 2 loops. Work back. Work 8 rows more as the last.</p>

<p>21st row&mdash;Raise a loop and increase as before; then put the needle into the next 5 loops, and
bring the wool through them all as one stitch; increase again and raise 2 loops: there will
now be 7 loops. Work back.</p>

<p>22nd row&mdash;Raise a loop and increase; then take the next 3 loops together; increase and raise
2 loops. Work back. Work 20 rows more as the last, or any length preferred.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Edge</span>&mdash;With the colored wool, work loosely a row of plain crochet all round the lappet,
putting the needle into the spaces formed by the increased stitches. 2 chain and an extra
plain stitch should be made at the two ends and centre of the first white row.</p>

<p>Make sufficient of the Scallop Trimming, <a href="#TATTING_SCALLOP_TRIMMING">page 11</a>, to go round the Lappet, using the colored
wool doubled, and the smaller mesh for the pearl loops. For the crochet row the wool is to
be single.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Joining</span>&mdash;work with the Floss Silk, which had better be used double. Commence at the
colored row, round the Lappet, and work a plain crochet stitch; then take out the needle
and put it into the last stitch of the Scallop Trimming, taking both edges of the plain row,
bring the Floss through; then work another plain stitch on the lappet, taking both edges,
continue joining and working a plain stitch alternately.</p>

<p>Work a row of Cross stitches with the Floss silk up the centre.</p>

<p>Make the other Lappet the same, sew them to the crown and attach two flowers at each side.</p>

</div>
</div>



<div class="blockquot_ans">
<p><i>Materials&mdash;For the Cape, 4 ounces of single or double Wool, and for the Trimmings 3 skeins of
double Berlin Wool of a color which contrasts; Walker’s Tricot Needle No. 7 Bell gauge,
a large Tatting Shuttle, and a round Mesh No. 1 Bell gauge.</i></p>
</div>

<p>This Cape is worked in open Crochet ornamented with Tatting, see the <a href="#frontispiece">Frontispiece</a>.</p>

<p>It will be greatly improved if Floss Silk is introduced as described in the Opera Hood. The
centre should then be white with colored Trimming, but any two colors that contrast will
look well, as Pearl Grey with Crimson, Mauve with Amber, or Violet with Grey.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Divisions.</span></p>

<p>Commence with the Wool for the centre, and make 15 chain stitches.</p>

<p>1st row&mdash;Miss the last 4 chain and work a plain crochet stitch in the next stitch; (then
2 chain, miss 1 and 1 plain, 5 times); turn back. It should measure 3 inches in length
without stretching. If single Wool is used it should be worked loosely.</p>

<p>2nd row&mdash;Work 3 chain, miss 1 and 1 treble in the last 2 chain; then 2 chain, miss 2 and 1
plain in each loop of 2 chain to the end; turn back.</p>

<p>3rd row&mdash;Work the same as the 2nd row.</p>

<p>4th row&mdash;3 chain, miss 1, 1 treble in the last loop of chain; then 2 chain, miss 2, and 1 plain
as before to the end; and to Increase a loop work 3 chain and 1 plain in the same loop as
the last plain stitch; turn back.</p>

<p>5th row&mdash;Work the same as the 4th row.</p>

<p>Repeat the last 4 rows 6 times more. As the work will increase two loops every four rows
there will now be 20 loops. It is intended that the work should be longer at the sides than
in the centre of the division.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">{7}</span></p>

<p>30th row&mdash;3 chain, miss 1 and 1 treble; then 2 chain, miss 2 and 1 plain as before, for 7
loops, then work 5 loops, making only 1 chain instead of 2 chain; then work 7 loops with
2 chain, and increase in the last loop.</p>

<p>31st row&mdash;3 chain, miss 1, 1 treble, then work 7 loops with 2 chain; 6 loops with 1 chain,
and 7 loops of 2 chain; then increase at the end.</p>

<p>32nd row&mdash;Work 1 chain, miss 1 and 1 plain in each loop of chain to the end; then 1 chain
and 1 plain in the last loop. Work 2 rows more as the last, and fasten off.</p>

<p>Work five Divisions more the same, and sew the slanting sides of them together. Three
rounds of 1 chain, miss 1 and 1 plain, should be worked along the neck, then commencing
at the right point work a plain row up the front, across the neck, and down the other side.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Trimming in Tatting.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Rosette</span>&mdash;Fill the Shuttle with the Wool and using the mesh for the pearl loops, commence
a loop, work 1 double, (then make a pearl and work a double stitch alternately for 7
loops); draw close. Keep the Wool at the back and join it to the centre pearl.</p>

<p>Work another Rosette the same, and join it to the same pearl of the previous Rosette as
before; then keep the Wool as the back and join to the centre pearl of the last Rosette.
Repeat the last Rosette until sufficient is made for the sides and border, to which it is to be
attached by sewing it with the same colored Wool.</p>

<p>The Rosettes down the Divisions are made in the same manner, but as they are to be smaller,
only 5 pearls instead of 7 pearls are to be made for each Rosette.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Balls</span>&mdash;Take a yard of the Wool the same color as the Tatting, split it three times,
and wind it round the tops of the first and second fingers, take it off the fingers and
wind a piece of fine thread about three times very tightly round the middle of the wool,
knotting the ends together, also tie in a piece of the wool not split, to form the thread to
attach the Balls to the work; cut the wool at each end, rounding it into the shape.</p>

<p>Make sufficient of these Balls to go all round the Edge, placing them about two inches apart.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Materials&mdash;4 skeins of Scarlet and 2 of Black double Berlin Wool, or 4-ply Fleecy, Walker’s
Tricot Needle No. 6 Bell gauge.</i></p>


<p>Commence the Outside with the Black wool, and make a chain of 34 stitches. See Instructions
for this stitch <a href="#Page_28">page 28</a>.</p>

<p>1st row&mdash;Miss the last chain stitch. * Put the needle into the next chain stitch, and bring the
wool through it in a loop. Repeat from * until there are 34 loops on the needle. Then join
on the scarlet wool, and “Work Back.” Join on the black wool.</p>

<p>2nd row&mdash;Work with the Black wool, and raise all the loops of the last row; then join on the
scarlet wool and Work back.</p>

<p>Repeat as the last row until 16 inches are worked; then, to shape the Flap or part which falls
over the pocket, work the same stitch, but decreasing at the beginning and end of every
row by taking two stitches together until it is reduced to a point.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Lining.</span></p>

<p>Work with the Scarlet wool and make a piece the same as the outside; when finished it is to
be made round by joining the foundation row to the one before the flap is begun, so as to
leave it on the outside.</p>

<p>For the Pocket take a piece of merino or silk the length of the muff, and about 8 inches deep
double it, and sew the double part to the Lining 4 inches below the joining; then sew one
edge of the silk to the joining. Wadding is to be placed between the lining and the outside,
which is now to be sewn at the sides and round the flap, but the foundation row is to be
joined to the other edge of the pocket. Finish with a Fur Trimming or Border, as given
in the Winter Book, 1862, round the end and flap, which must be secured with a loop and
button.</p>

<p>1st row&mdash;Miss the last chain stitch. * Put the needle into the next stitch, and bring the wool
through in a loop. Repeat from * until there are 7 loops on the needle. Work back. See
Instructions, <a href="#Page_28">page 28</a>, at the end of the book.</p>

<p>2nd row&mdash;Raise the 7 loops of the 1st row, and work back.</p>

<p>3rd row&mdash;Raise a loop, then Increase a loop by putting the needle between the upright stitches;
Raise 3 loops as usual; then Increase another loop; raise the 2 last loops. Work back.</p>

<p>4th row&mdash;Raise a loop, Increase, raise 5 loops, increase again, raise 2 loops. Work back.</p>

<p>5th Row&mdash;Raise a loop, increase, raise 7 loops, increase again, raise 2 loops. Work back.</p>

<p>6th row&mdash;Raise a loop, increase, then raise all the loops to within two of the end; increase
again, and raise the two last loops. Work back. The work should be loose. As a guide
for the size of the stitch, the last row should measure 4 inches across, and these 6 rows 2½
inches in depth.</p>

<p>Work 5 rows more the same as the 6th row.</p>

<p>12th row&mdash;Raise all the loops without increasing, and work back.</p>

<p>Work 4 rows as the 6th row, that is increasing 2 stitches each row, and then work every
5th row without increasing until 37 rows in all are worked, when there will be 65 stitches.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">{10}</span></p>

<p>Work 4 rows without shaping. If for an extra size a few more rows may be added here, and
also at the plain rows on each shoulder. This finishes the back.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">To Shape the Right Front</span>&mdash;1st row&mdash;Raise all the loops of the last row until there are 28
on the needle. Work back.</p>

<p>2nd and 3rd rows&mdash;Raise all the loops to the two last, then decrease by taking these loops
together as one stitch. Work back.</p>

<p>4th row&mdash;Raise a loop, then decrease as before, raise the rest to the end. Work back.</p>

<p>Then work 4 rows plain without shaping.</p>

<p>Repeat as the 4th row, and the 4 rows plain after it, 5 times more; that is decreasing a stitch
at the beginning of every 5th row; the left selvedge should be quite straight.</p>

<p>Then to shape the end, decrease a stitch at the beginning and end of every 3rd row, until it is
reduced to a point.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">To Shape the Left Front</span>&mdash;1st row&mdash;Commence at the stitches left at the back, and leaving
9 for the neck, raise the remaining 28 loops as usual. Work back.</p>

<p>2nd and 3rd rows&mdash;Work 2 rows, decreasing a loop at the beginning of each row. All the
rows must now be kept straight at the beginning.</p>

<p>Work 4 rows plain, and at the end of every 5th row decrease a stitch, in all 6 times. Then
decrease a stitch at the beginning and end of every 3rd row until it is reduced to a point.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Dot</span>&mdash;Fill the Shuttle with the White Wool, and use the Tricot Needle for the pearl
loops. Commence a loop, work 3 double stitches, then (1 pearl loop and 3 double stitches
twice); draw quite close and reverse the work.</p>

<p>Commence the next Dot close to the last and repeat the dot, reversing them after each is
made. Work sufficient to go all round the Tricot.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Edge</span>&mdash;Work with the Black Wool, and commencing at the last pearl of the Dots, crochet
a plain stitch in it; then work another plain stitch in the next pearl of the same Dot,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">{11}</span>
and missing the Dot which turns down, work a plain stitch in the 1st pearl of the next
dot but one. Repeat working a plain stitch in the two pearls of every other dot.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Joining</span>&mdash;Work with the Black wool, and commencing at the left corner of the Tricot,
work a plain crochet stitch between the rows of it; then, to join the Tatting, take out the
needle, put it into a pearl of a Dot, and bringing the loop through work a plain stitch on the
Tricot, and continue the same until the Tatting is joined. To round the corners so that
the Border may lie flat, the needle should be put into the last pearl of one dot and the 1st
pearl of the next, and worked as one stitch. This should be done five or six times. With
the same colored wool as the Tricot, make sufficient of the Scalloped Trimming to go all
round, and join it to the black row of the Border with the black wool, always putting the
needle into both edges of the plain rows.</p>

<p>5th row&mdash;Continue raising all the stitches of the last row. Work back all the loops on the
needle.</p>

<p>6th row&mdash;Raise 4 loops, but in raising the 5th loop, put the needle into the next stitch of the
lower row, which is under the one ordinarily used. This will prevent any space showing
where the last row was turned. Raise the rest of the row as usual. Work back.</p>

<p>7th row&mdash;Raise all the loops without shaping. Work back.</p>

<p>Repeat the 4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th rows, 5 times more.</p>

so as to work on the selvedge formed by the end of the rows, putting the needle sufficiently
deep in the work to correspond with the edge row of the Sash: work 3 plain crochet
stitches; * then 1 treble in the next stitch, 1 chain, 1 treble, 1 chain, and 1 treble again;
these 3 treble stitches are all to be worked in the same stitch of the Veste, then work 7
plain; and repeat again from *, continuing the same all round to the opposite end at the
right side of the Veste. As the 3 treble stitches should come at the centre of the back, it
will be necessary to increase in rounding the point.</p>

<p>Make sufficient of the Scallop Trimming to go along this row, and join it the same as the
Sash. For the inner Border, commence at the last stitch of the right side of the Veste, and
work as the outer border. The last row of each of the sides is then to be sewn to the back
under the Border, and the Sash ends attached on the wrong side. The Veste should be
fastened with buttons down the front.</p>

<p>Commence with the Scarlet Wool, and make a chain of 33 stitches.</p>

<p>Work 2 rows of Tricot Ecossais as described at <a href="#Page_28">page 28</a>, then join on the Black Wool to finish
the last stitch.</p>

<p>3rd row&mdash;Black&mdash;Raise the 1st loop, then increase a loop, raise 13 loops; then decrease by

only 31 loops. Work back.</p>

manner as the 18th row, until the work is reduced to 23 stitches, when it will be about 30
inches in length.</p>

<p>As the number of stitches decreases each time the 18th row is worked, a less number of
stitches must be raised on each side of the centre.</p>

<p>To finish the Stripe work 3 rows, decreasing in the centre and leaving 2 stitches unworked at
each side; then work back to the right side, and end with a row of single crochet.</p>

<p>For an ordinary sized Petticoat 10 stripes will be required. The last stripes should not be
joined to the top.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Edge</span>&mdash;With the Black Wool commence at the top of the left side of a Stripe, and work
down the selvedge a row of plain Crochet, putting the needle into the open spaces formed
by the increased stitches. This row should be worked loosely. Continue this row across
the foundation, and up the right side of the Stripe. Work the other Stripes the same.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Joining Row</span>&mdash;With the White Wool commence at the black stitch even with the white
row of the stripe; work a single stitch on the stripe. Take a second stripe, put the needle
into the corresponding stitch of it, work another single stitch. Continue working a single
stitch alternately on each stripe, until they are joined; the needle should be put in both
edges of the black row. The first four rows of the stripes are to be sewn together with
Scarlet and Black Wool.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Border</span>&mdash;With the White Wool commence at the black row of the foundation, and work a
row of 1 chain, miss 1 and 1 plain; putting the needle in the same scarlet stitches as the
black row, so as to cover the alternate stitches of it. Repeat all round.</p>

<p class="clear"><b>H. Walker’s Needles</b> have long
enjoyed great popularity with those who
value really good Needles. They have
been greatly altered by Patented
Improvements of a most important
character.</p>

<p><b>H. Walker’s Patent Penelope
Crochets</b> have had so many imitations,
it is necessary to repeat the
request that all who wish for the true
Needle will see that the word “Penelope”
is on the handle.</p>

<p>The new Patent Uncotopic
Handles to the Penelope Needles
have the word “Uncotopic” on
each, and persons who would
avoid disappointment will please
to observe these trade marks.
The Uncotopic Handle keeps
the Needle at all times in the
true position for work, and is
invaluable alike to a beginner,
or to an accomplished worker.</p>

<p>The following is from “<i>The Engineer</i>,”
of May 4, 1859:&mdash;“Difficult as it may
appear to entirely change the structure
of so small an article, the figures above
show what may be done even with the
eye of a Needle.</p>

<p>“Fig. 1. A, is a ridge or slightly
raised part before the eye; B, the eye;
C, a groove beyond the eye into which
the thread falls.</p>

<p>“Fig. 2 is a side view of the part A, B, C,
showing the thread recessed as in sewing,
when the usual pressure of the thimble
drives the Needle with its thread
at once through the cloth, affording
relief of no ordinary character
to the tailor or seampstress,
and saving much of their time.
We have submitted these
Needles to a good judge of such
articles, who has declared them
superior to all others, not only
as above stated, but particularly
also with relation to facility
of threading.”</p>

<p><i><span class="smcap">Mlle. Riego de la Branchardiere</span> begs most gratefully to thank her correspondents for the
kind letters she has received during sorrow and illness, and trusts that any omissions on her part
will be excused now the cause is known.</i></p>

<p><i>She has also to inform them that for the future all her registered and copyright designs will be
signed with her surname in full, she having hitherto used only the first as more convenient for
business; but as she has reason to believe that there has been a recent infringement and use of her
name, it has become advisable for her to vary her signature, otherwise she cannot so readily detect
fraud.</i></p>

<p><i>Mlle. Riego de la Branchardiere must caution ladies against purchasing any of her designs
without the whole signature, as she is informed by law it is against the purchaser only she must
proceed in case it should be necessary to assert her rights.</i></p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.
</div>

<div style='display:block; font-size:1.1em; margin:1em 0; font-weight:bold'>
Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div>
</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg&#8482;
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg&#8482;.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg&#8482; works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:
</div>

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &bull; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, &#8220;Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg

        &bull; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &bull; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

        receipt of the work.
    </div>

forth in Section 3 below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &#8216;AS-IS&#8217;, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.
</div>

<div style='display:block; font-size:1.1em; margin:1em 0; font-weight:bold'>
Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
